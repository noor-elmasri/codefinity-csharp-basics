# C# Fundamentals – Learning Repository

This repository documents my learning journey in the fundamentals of C#. 
While C# is not my primary focus, I am learning it to build a strong background 
in programming concepts related to web graphics, interactive applications, and 
eventually simple game development.

I approach C# as a creative tool, similar to how I write stories for enjoyment — 
focusing on understanding logic, structure, and how different components work together.
This repository serves as a space to practice, revisit core concepts, and track progress.

## This Repository Includes

Practice exercises and challenges covering:

- Basic C# syntax and program structure
- Console output and comments
- Variables, identifiers, and operators
- Data types and type conversion
- Control structures (conditional logic)
- Loops
- Arrays
- Methods

Each section reflects structured learning through coursework and guided practice.

## Learning Goals

- Build a solid foundation in C# fundamentals
- Understand how logic and structure apply to interactive applications
- Strengthen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Prepare for future exploration of graphics, game logic, and creative programming projects

## Learning Status

This repository is **in progress**.
Content is added gradually as I progress through structured lessons and challenges.

---

## Tools & Resources

- C#
- Codefinity (learning platform)

## Notes

This repository represents learning progress rather than a finished product.
The code is intentionally simple and may be refactored or expanded as my understanding grows.
